# boot.dev backend journey 

This repo contains my daily backend development practice from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).  
Each folder represents a module, lesson, or project with code, tests, and notes.

 ## Structure
 
- `day01_hello_world/`
- `day02_dicts/`
- `day03_loops/`
- ...
- `personal_projects/`

 ## Goals

 - Build a daily artifact (function, script, project) from Boot.dev.
- Commit every day to document progress.
- Develop into production-ready backend projects for portfolio use.
